## General Information
The purpose of this project is to create a program to determine an efficient route to deliver packages with given assumptions and restrictions. In addition, an interface is provided not only for the user to view the information of any package but also the status of all packages at a particular time. 

## Development Environment
- IDE: PyCharm 2022.1.3 (Community Edition)
- Python 3.10

## Interface
Basic command line interface is implemented in this program. After running the program in IDE, user will know the total mileage traveled by all trucks and interact with the system by selecting from 3 options.

## Improvement
To meet each packageâ€™s requirements and allocate packages to truck, packages was prioritized and sorted manually in excel file. If there is a function to dynamically sort the package according to different criteria instead of sorting manually, The whole program will handle package loading and delivery with various restrictions automatically and reduce the manual process.
